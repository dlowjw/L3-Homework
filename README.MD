    - cd into the new directory through your terminal
    - Run `npm install` to install all the dependency packages
    - to see your project working, use the command `npm run dev`

- Build a landing page using React (find a cool website to use as inspiration, don't worry about navigation for now) 
    - If they have photos, take them from the website to use or find replacements for them
    - Try to get it to look as similar to the site as you can
